Show your Real Estate listings on your Wordpress site. Simply Rets provides a very simple set up and full control over your listings.


== Description ==

The Simply Rets plugin allows you integrate your live Real Estate
listings directly on your Wordpress site with little to no hassle.
This plugin requires a plan with [Simply Rets](https://simplyrets.com),
but demo listing data is provided for you to test out and make sure
the plugin does what you're looking for. Getting started with the
Simply Rets plugin is as easy as installing it and creating a new
page!

In order to get your properties on your site, there are only a
couple of things you need:

* You must be a current member of an MLS provider. This is who we get your properties from (which we'll take care of).
* You must have an active plan with [Simply Rets](https://simplyrets.com). We offer a wide variety of plans to accommodate most situations. Visit our website for me details on pricing and how to get started.

The Simply Rets plugin generates accurate and correct HTML and does
*not* use iframes or ever take your visitors away from your site -
which we've learned is essential for materializing online leads. The
power is put back in your hands by giving you full control of which of
your listings to show, and on which pages.

The plugin also provides you extensions on many standard Wordpress features:

* A custom 'Rets Listings' page type for creating pages with listing results.
* Sidebar and footer widgets for Featured Listings, Search, etc.
* Plenty of short-codes for splicing your listings into any page or post.
* Filters for searches, custom pages, etc.

Simply Rets provides the fastest and most up-to-date solution for
embedding your listings on your site. Simply Rets will update as
frequently as every hour (or as frequent as your MLS provider
allows). This means that you're ahead of the competition and can have
the fastest possible response time for dealing with interested
prospects.

This plugin is fast!. You don't have to worry about slowing down
your website by pulling lots of data on every page load. The Simply
Rets plugin is optimized to only load on the correct pages, and to
only load the listings you choose. By doing this, you are able to keep
visitors on your site to look at more properties. If you offer the
fastest searching solution in your city, why would they go any where
else?

Simply Rets uses the RETS (Real Estate Standards Organization)
protocol and has 100% coverage and compatibility with the RETS
standard. This allows you to be on the leading technical edge and
provides you with many advantages of IDX (internet data exchange)
including response speed, compatibility across multiple MLS areas, and
up-time.  So while your competition is working on getting properties
on their site, you can install the Simply Rets Wordpress plugin and
spend more time actually selling!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin for free? =

Yes! The Simply Rets Wordpress plugin comes with free demo listings
that you can use on your site.  Mostly, this should be used for
testing the plugin to make sure it fits your needs. To show *your*
listings on your site, you will need an active plan with [Simply Rets](https://simplyrets.com).

= Can I use my existing Wordpress theme? =

Yes! The Simply Rets plugin generates widely compatible and responsive
HTML for your pages. It has tested on and made to work with many
different types of Wordpress themes. If you find a theme that this
plugin does not work with, let us know! The plugin does *not* use
iFrame, but generates and embeds the HTML directly on your site, which
means that your visitors get the best experience possible when
browsing your listings.

= Is it possible to use my own CSS or change the styling? =

Absolutely! The plugin comes with very versatile CSS, but you may want
to add your own style and personal touch to it. We've created a very
simple set of CSS classes and ID's for you to use to change the
styles.  You can start by installing one of the many custom CSS
Wordpress plugins, or if you're using a Child Theme, you can put it
directly in your child-custom.css/style.css.  You can find the Simply
Rets Style Documentation in the Documentation section of the website:
[Simply Rets Style Documentation](https://docs.simplyrets.com).


= How do I show *my* listings through this plugin? =

Once you've decided that the plugin does what you need it to do, you
can contact us at [the Simply Rets
website](https://simplyrets.com#home-contact). We'll get you signed up and provide
you with an API username and password. Starting to use your real
listings is as easy as plugging the API credentials into the Wordpress
Admin settings page (`Settings -> Simply Rets`) and hitting save! If the
credentials are valid, your listings will start to show
automatically. If they are invalid, the test data will continue to be
used.


= How often are the listings refreshed? =

Simply Rets will keep the most up-to-date listings on your site. We
will refresh the feed as often as the MLS provider allows, which is
usually in the the 1-2 hour range.


= Do I have to be signed up with an MLS provider? =

Yes. In order for us to get your listings to you, we need to get them
from your MLS provider, We'll handle all the dirty work for getting
that set up, and you can worry about the important things like making
more sales!

= I want to only show my listings, and not my whole office. Is that possible? =

The Simply Rets plugins provides 'filters' for all the listings on
your site. For example, if you create a new Simply Rets page, you can
add an Agent Filter on that page which will take your Agent MLS
Id. Then when that page is loaded, only listings tied to that Agent
MLS Id will be shown.

= How long can I use the test data? =

You can use the test data for as long as you need! The only
restriction for the test data is that you must make less than 1,000
requests a day. Other than that, keep in mind that the test data
listings are *not* real properties, but it does provide the same
fields that we will get from your MLS provider.
