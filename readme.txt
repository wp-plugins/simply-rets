= Using the Test Listings =

To use the free trial listings, all you need to do is install it and
start creating pages!  The test credentials are already saved in the
plugin when you install it, so you can spend more time making an
awesome real estate website.

= Features & Documentation =

To use the available widgets, and short-codes - start by reading over
[the Documentation page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-rets/other_notes/).

The [GitHub README](https://github.com/rbros/simplyretswp) also provides a good starting
point for developers looking to customize some features.

As always, you can email [support@simplyrets.com](mailto:support@simplyrets.com) for any
questions you can't find an answer to!

= How it Works =

The SimplyRETS plugin generates accurate and correct HTML and does
*not* use iframes or ever take your visitors away from your site -
which we've learned is essential for materializing online leads. The
power is put back in your hands by giving you full control of which of
your listings to show, and on which pages.

The plugin also provides you extensions on many standard Wordpress features:

* A robust set of shortcodes and attributes to build virtually any type of page you can imagine.
* A custom 'SimplyRETS Listings' page type for creating pages with listing results.
* Sidebar and footer widgets for Featured Listings, Search, etc.
* Plenty of short-codes for splicing your listings into any page or post.
* Filters for searches, custom pages, etc.

SimplyRETS provides the fastest and most up-to-date solution for
embedding your listings on your site. SimplyRETS will update as
frequently as every hour (or as frequent as your MLS provider
allows). This means that you're ahead of the competition and can have
the fastest possible response time for dealing with interested
prospects.

This plugin is fast!. You don't have to worry about slowing down
your website by pulling lots of data on every page load. The SimplyRETS
plugin is optimized to only load on the correct pages, and to
only load the listings you choose. By doing this, you are able to keep
visitors on your site to look at more properties. If you offer the
fastest searching solution in your city, why would they go any where
else?

SimplyRETS uses the RETS (Real Estate Standards Organization)
protocol and has 100% coverage and compatibility with the RETS
standard. This allows you to be on the leading technical edge and
provides you with many advantages of IDX (internet data exchange)
including response speed, compatibility across multiple MLS areas, and
up-time.  So while your competition is working on getting properties
on their site, you can install the SimplyRETS Wordpress plugin and
spend more time actually selling!



== Installation ==

You can simply install this plugin a couple of different ways:

= Wordpress Plugin Directory =

1. If you usually install plugins via the Wordpress Dashboard 'Add
Plugins' page, you can just search for 'SimplyRETS' and click
install!

= Install from the .zip: =

1. Download the `.zip` file

1. In your Wordpress dashboard, go to `Plugins -> Add New`. Choose `Upload a New Plugin` and upload the `.zip` file.

= Manual install from .zip: =

1. Download the `.zip` file and extract it into your sites `wp-content/plugins` directory

1. Be sure to extract it into a directory called `wp-content/plugins/simply-rets/`.

= Activating =

Once you have the plugin installed via one of the methods above, you
can go to the Plugins page of your Wordpress site and click `activate`
on SimplyRETS. Once successfully activated, you can start using the
demo listings, or enter your SimplyRETS credentials to start getting
your listings!



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin for free? =

Yes! The SimplyRETS Wordpress plugin comes with free demo listings
that you can use on your site.  Mostly, this should be used for
testing the plugin to make sure it fits your needs. To show *your*
listings on your site, you will need an active plan with [SimplyRETS](https://simplyrets.com).

= Can I use my existing Wordpress theme? =

Yes! The SimplyRETS plugin generates widely compatible and responsive
HTML for your pages. It has tested on and made to work with many
different types of Wordpress themes. If you find a theme that this
plugin does not work with, let us know! The plugin does *not* use
iframes, but generates and embeds the HTML directly on your site, which
means that your visitors get the best experience possible when
browsing your listings.

= Is it possible to use my own CSS or change the styling? =

Absolutely! The plugin comes with very versatile CSS, but you may want
to add your own style and personal touch to it. We've created a very
simple set of CSS classes and ID's for you to use to change the
styles.  You can start by installing one of the many custom CSS
Wordpress plugins, or if you're using a Child Theme, you can put it
directly in your child-custom.css/style.css.  You can find the SimplyRETS
Style Documentation in the Documentation section of the website:
[SimplyRETS Style Documentation](https://docs.simplyrets.com).

= How do I show *my* listings through this plugin? =

Once you've decided that the plugin does what you need it to do, you
can contact us at [the SimplyRETS
website](https://simplyrets.com#home-contact). We'll get you signed up and provide
you with an API username and password. Starting to use your real
listings is as easy as plugging the API credentials into the Wordpress
Admin settings page (`Settings -> SimplyRETS`) and hitting save! If the
credentials are valid, your listings will start to show
automatically. If they are invalid, the test data will continue to be
used.

= How often are the listings refreshed? =

SimplyRETS will keep the most up to date listings on your site. We
will refresh on average every 2 hours.

= Do I have to be signed up with an MLS provider? =

Yes. In order for the plugin to show your listings, you first need to
get a RETS feed set up with your MLS provider.

= I want to only show my listings, and not my whole office. Is that possible? =

The SimplyRETS plugins provides 'filters' for all the listings on
your site. For example, if you create a new SimplyRETS page, you can
add an Agent Filter on that page which will take your Agent MLS
Id. Then when that page is loaded, only listings tied to that Agent
MLS Id will be shown.

= How long can I use the test data? =

You can use the test data for as long as you need! The only
restriction for the test data is that you must make less than 1,000
requests a day. Other than that, keep in mind that the test data
listings are *not* real properties, but it does provide the same
fields that we will get from your MLS provider.

== Documentation ==

The SimplyRETS plugin makes it easy an intuitive to show your listings
on your site in a way that *you* want. There's virtually no
restrictions to how you can customize the plugin and your site.

The plugin is based around shortcodes; there are shortcodes for
listings, search forms, sliders, and more. Each of these shortcodes
takes attributes that refine which listings are pulled. For example:

To show listings from your entire MLS:

[sr_listings]

but to only show listings from a specific agent:

[sr_listings agent="AGENTID"]

..read more about the available attributes [here][shortcode attributes].

== Contents ==
- Shortcodes
  - Listings
  - Search Form
  - Listing Slider
  - Available attributes

- Widgets

- Test Listings

- SimplyRETS Pages

- Custom CSS

- Support / More Documentation


== Shortcodes ==

Most of the plugin is built around using shortcodes. This allows the
most flexibility for customizing your own layout and search pages.


= SimplyRETS Listings Shortcode =

`[sr_listings]`

This is the main shortcode for showing listings on any page of your
site. Put this shortcode onto any page and, voila, you've got
listings!

This shortcode takes many different [attributes][shortcodes
attributes], and you can combine almost any of them.

If you want to use the listings shortcode, but only show listings
above $500,000 then you would simply add the `minprice` attribute:

`[sr_listings minprice="500000"]`

So how about the same minimum price, but only for one specific agent?
Easy!

`[sr_listings minprice="500000" agent="ID"]`

(*Note: the ID is provided by your MLS*)


= SimplyRETS Search Form Shortcode =

`[sr_search_form]`

Next up is the search form shortcode. This is what ties together the
ability to search and view listings.

This shortcode also takes a few different attributes, but not quite as
many as the listings shortcode because the user will change them.

For example, you can set up a search form that will only search form
that will always search one specific office or brokerage:

`[sr_search_form brokers="ID"]`

(*Note: the ID is provided by your MLS*)

There are several use-cases for the search form and you can put it
anywhere on your site you want! The two most common ways to use the
search form are:

1. On the landing area of your homepage, to get the visitor to start a
   search immediately.
1. To be used in combination with the listings shortcode, like so:

`[sr_search_form]`
`[sr_listings]`

This builds a nice page with an initial set of listings, which
promotes the visitor to continue making a search.


= Listings Slider Shortcode =

`[sr_listings_slider]`

The listing slider is a great feature that allows you to build a
'slider' of listings. See [screenshot #7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-rets/screenshots/)
for a quick glance of how it works.


The slider shortcode takes all the same attributes as the listings
shortcode, which is all of them. So to make a slider with listings
over $500,000:

`[sr_listings_slider minprice="500000"]`

And the same minimum price, but only for one specific agent? Easy!

`[sr_listings_slider minprice="500000" agent="ID"]`

(*Note: the ID is provided by your MLS*)


= Available Attributes =

There are ton of attributes available for refining the listings in any
way you can imagine. Each of these attributes can be used in any of
the shortcodes, and you can use (most of) them in combination with
each other like the examples above:

* **mlsid**
Fetches a single listing by it's mlsid.
`[sr_listings mlsid="12345"]`

* **status**
Refines listings by a certain status, like Active, Pending, or Closed.

* **minbeds**
Set a minimum amount of bedrooms.
`[sr_listings minbeds="3"]`

Set a maximum amount of bedrooms.
`[sr_listings maxbeds="3"]`

* **minbaths**
Set a minimum amount of baths.
`[sr_listings minbaths="3"]`

* **maxbaths**
Set a maximum amount of baths.
`[sr_listings maxbaths="3"]`

* **q**
A fuzzy keyword search that will include listings matching a given string.

* **amenities**

`[sr_listings cities="Granite; Balcony"]`

* **features**

`[sr_listings cities="Tennis Court; Waterfront"]`

* **vendor**
Refines listings by a certain vendor or MLS Board. (This is only available when your account has multiple MLS's).
`[sr_listings vendor="MFRMLS"]`

* **limit**
The amount of listings to return. Default is 20, maximum is 50.
`[sr_listings limit="50"]`

* **offset**
Returns a set of listings and skips the first *n*, where *n* is the offset.
`[sr_listings offset="20"]`

* **sort**
Displays the listings in a specific order.
`[sr_listings sort="price"]`

(The available sort options are `listprice`, `-listprice`,
`listdate`, `-listdate`, `baths`, `-baths`, `beds`, and `-beds`.
Options starting the a minus (-) are high to low, no minus sign is
low to high).

* **advanced**
This attribute is to turn the basic search form into an advanced search form.
`[sr_search_form advanced="true"]`


== SimplyRETS Widgets ==

The SimplyRETS plugin comes with several widgets you can use in you
sidebar and footer. The currently available widgets include:

* **Search Form Widget**
  The search form widget allows you to add an MLS search in the
  sidebar or footer of your site.

* **Featured Listing Widget**
  This takes one listing MLS id, and will embed the property in a
  widget with a link to the details page of that property

* **Random Listing Widget**
  This is similar to the Featured Listing Widget, but takes multiple
  MLS Id's. On each page load, it will show one of the listings
  provided.

* **Agents Listing Widget**
  The search form widget allows you to add an MLS search in the
  sidebar or footer of your site.


== Trial Listings ==

You can use the Trial Listings as much as you need before you set up
your own. They only contain a subset of the options that are available
from most MLS's, but there is plenty to work with! Here's how to get
hem set up:

* Navigate to the SimplyRETS Settings page in your Wordpress dashboard
  `Settings -> SimplyRETS`

* Insert the testing API Keys (Username: simplyrets Password:
  simplyrets)

The trial listings are activated automatically - so if you're
installing the plugin for the first time, you don't need to do the
above steps.


== SimplyRETS Pages ==

SimplyRETS pages allow for an easy way to get up and running with new
pages. Here's a few tips:

* To create a new page, navigate to `SimplyRETS -> Add New Page` in
  your Wordpress dashboard. (by default these pages will show all of
  your listings - 25 per page). Name it, publish it, and you're done!

* You can add filters to this page by editing the post and using the
  **Filter Results on this Page** options.

* You can add filters for price, agent, min/max bed, min/max bath and
  more.

* SimplyRETS Pages give you the ability to choose from your theme's
  available templates.


*Note*: it is usually recommended to use the shortcodes directly since
they give you much more control and options, however if you're a
theme developer then customizing the SimplyRETS pages may be the best
option.


== Customizing the CSS ==

We're are totally OK with you tweaking the CSS and changing it to fit your needs. As a matter of fact, we want you to!

If you need to add any custom styling you can add custom CSS using our
Style Guide. The Style Guide will show you which classes and id's to
use to when adding your own css. You can find it here:
