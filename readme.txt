Show your Real Estate listings on your Wordpress site. SimplyRETS provides a very simple set up and full control over your listings.


== Description ==

= Getting Started =

The SimplyRETS plugin allows you to display and search your real
estate listings directly on your Wordpress site. The setup takes
less than 5 minutes, and we even supply public listings for you
to test with. We never use iframes, so you get all the SEO benefits!

To get your listings showing through the plugin, you need 3 things:

* [Create an account with SimplyRETS](https://simplyrets.com/account)
* Activate a RETS feed with your MLS (we'll help here, and if you already have a feed - even better!)
* Start getting LIVE listings right on your site!

= Using the Test Listings =

To use the free test listings to try out the plugin, all you need to
do is install it and start creating pages!  The test credentials are
already saved in the plugin when you install it, so you can spend more
time making and awesome real estate website.

= Features & Documentation =

To use the available widgets, and shortcodes - start by reading over
[the Documentation section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-rets/other_notes/) of
the Wordpress ReadMe.

The [Github ReadMe](https://github.com/rbros/simplyretswp) also provides a good starting
point for customizing some of the features.

As always, you can email [support@simplyrets.com](mailto:support@simplyrets.com) for any
questions you can't find an answer to!

= How it Works =

The SimplyRETS plugin generates accurate and correct HTML and does
*not* use iframes or ever take your visitors away from your site -
which we've learned is essential for materializing online leads. The
power is put back in your hands by giving you full control of which of
your listings to show, and on which pages.

The plugin also provides you extensions on many standard Wordpress features:

* A custom 'Rets Listings' page type for creating pages with listing results.
* Sidebar and footer widgets for Featured Listings, Search, etc.
* Plenty of short-codes for splicing your listings into any page or post.
* Filters for searches, custom pages, etc.

SimplyRETS provides the fastest and most up-to-date solution for
embedding your listings on your site. SimplyRETS will update as
frequently as every hour (or as frequent as your MLS provider
allows). This means that you're ahead of the competition and can have
the fastest possible response time for dealing with interested
prospects.

This plugin is fast!. You don't have to worry about slowing down
your website by pulling lots of data on every page load. The SimplyRETS
plugin is optimized to only load on the correct pages, and to
only load the listings you choose. By doing this, you are able to keep
visitors on your site to look at more properties. If you offer the
fastest searching solution in your city, why would they go any where
else?

SimplyRETS uses the RETS (Real Estate Standards Organization)
protocol and has 100% coverage and compatibility with the RETS
standard. This allows you to be on the leading technical edge and
provides you with many advantages of IDX (internet data exchange)
including response speed, compatibility across multiple MLS areas, and
up-time.  So while your competition is working on getting properties
on their site, you can install the SimplyRETS Wordpress plugin and
spend more time actually selling!



== Installation ==

You can simply install this plugin a couple of different ways:

= Wordpress Plugin Directory =

1. If you usually install plugins via the Wordpress Dashboard 'Add
Plugins' page, you can just search for 'SimplyRETS' and click
install!

= Install from the .zip: =

1. Download the `.zip` file

1. In your Wordpress dashboard, go to `Plugins -> Add New`. Choose `Upload a New Plugin` and upload the `.zip` file.

= Manual install from .zip: =

1. Download the `.zip` file and extract it into your sites `wp-content/plugins` directory

1. Be sure to extract it into a directory called `wp-content/plugins/simply-rets/`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin for free? =

Yes! The SimplyRETS Wordpress plugin comes with free demo listings
that you can use on your site.  Mostly, this should be used for
testing the plugin to make sure it fits your needs. To show *your*
listings on your site, you will need an active plan with [SimplyRETS](https://simplyrets.com).

= Can I use my existing Wordpress theme? =

Yes! The SimplyRETS plugin generates widely compatible and responsive
HTML for your pages. It has tested on and made to work with many
different types of Wordpress themes. If you find a theme that this
plugin does not work with, let us know! The plugin does *not* use
iFrame, but generates and embeds the HTML directly on your site, which
means that your visitors get the best experience possible when
browsing your listings.

= Is it possible to use my own CSS or change the styling? =

Absolutely! The plugin comes with very versatile CSS, but you may want
to add your own style and personal touch to it. We've created a very
simple set of CSS classes and ID's for you to use to change the
styles.  You can start by installing one of the many custom CSS
Wordpress plugins, or if you're using a Child Theme, you can put it
directly in your child-custom.css/style.css.  You can find the SimplyRETS
Style Documentation in the Documentation section of the website:
[SimplyRETS Style Documentation](https://docs.simplyrets.com).


= How do I show *my* listings through this plugin? =

Once you've decided that the plugin does what you need it to do, you
can contact us at [the SimplyRETS
website](https://simplyrets.com#home-contact). We'll get you signed up and provide
you with an API username and password. Starting to use your real
listings is as easy as plugging the API credentials into the Wordpress
Admin settings page (`Settings -> SimplyRETS`) and hitting save! If the
credentials are valid, your listings will start to show
automatically. If they are invalid, the test data will continue to be
used.


= How often are the listings refreshed? =

SimplyRETS will keep the most up-to-date listings on your site. We
will refresh the feed as often as the MLS provider allows, which is
usually in the the 1-2 hour range.


= Do I have to be signed up with an MLS provider? =

Yes. In order for us to get your listings to you, we need to get them
from your MLS provider, We'll handle all the dirty work for getting
that set up, and you can worry about the important things like making
more sales!

= I want to only show my listings, and not my whole office. Is that possible? =

The SimplyRETS plugins provides 'filters' for all the listings on
your site. For example, if you create a new SimplyRETS page, you can
add an Agent Filter on that page which will take your Agent MLS
Id. Then when that page is loaded, only listings tied to that Agent
MLS Id will be shown.

= How long can I use the test data? =

You can use the test data for as long as you need! The only
restriction for the test data is that you must make less than 1,000
requests a day. Other than that, keep in mind that the test data
listings are *not* real properties, but it does provide the same
fields that we will get from your MLS provider.

== Documentation ==

There is much more documentation for both the SimplyRETS API, and the
SimplyRETS Wordpress plugin. You can dig into all of that on the
SimplyRETS Docs website: [SimplyRETS Documentation](https://docs.simplyrets.com)

= Plugin Shortcodes, Widgets, and more! =


= Using the Test MLS Listings =

- Navigate to the SimplyRETS Settings page in your Wordpress dashboard
  (Settings -> SimplyRETS)
- To use the test listings, insert the testing API Keys (Username:
  simplyrets Password: simplyrets)

Note, the test listings are activated automatically - so if you're
installing the plugin for the first time, you don't need to do the
above steps.


= SimplyRETS Pages =

You can create SimplyRETS pages to show your listings.

- To create a new page, navigate to SimplyRETS -> Add New Page in your
  Wordpress dashboard. (by default these pages will show all of your
  listings - 25 per page)
- You can add filters to this page by editing the post and using the
  "Filter Results on this Page" options
- You can add filters for price, agent, min/max bed, min/max bath and
  more.
- SimplyRETS Pages give you the ability to choose from your theme's
  available templates.


= SimplyRETS Shortcodes =

To add dynamic MLS listings to any post or page on your site, there are shortcodes available

- Single Listing Shortcode - [sr_residential mlsid="76933149"] (be
  sure to enter the mlsid for the property you want to show)
- Multiple Listing Shortcode - [sr_residential] - This will by default
  show 25 listings. You can narrow this down by using filters here as
  well, i.e. - [sr_residential minbath="2"] or [sr_residential minprice="500000"]
- Search Form Shortcode - [sr_search_form] - You can use the shortcode
  on any page or post to embed an MLS search.


= SimplyRETS Widgets =

The plugin also comes with several widgets you may find helpful to use in your sidebar or footer

- Featured Listing Widget - This takes one listing MLS id, and will
  embed the property in a widget with a link to the details page of
  that property
- Random Listing Widget - This is similar to the Featured Listing
  Widget, but takes multiple MLS Id's. On each page load, it will show
  one of the listings provided.
- Search Form Widget - The search form widget allows you to add an MLS
  search in the sidebar or footer of your site.


= Custom CSS for the SimplyRETS plugin =

If you need to add any custom Styling to the plugin to make it look
more like your theme - you can add custom CSS using our Style
Guide. The Style Guide will show you which classes and Id's to use to
add styling to the plugin. You can find it here:

application than worrying about how to get the correct listings from
your MLS provider.
